# Editorconfig dotfile for Moodle

This repository offers a ready-to-use configuration file respecting [Moodle coding standards](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/codingstyle).


## What is .editorconfig?
EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of **a file format** for defining coding styles and a collection of **text editor plugins** that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.
